# Java-Codespace
While searching on GitHub, I really missed a repository that will contain the Java codes for every coding problem.
Thus, this repository is open for everyone to contribute the codes as well as the problem statement , most preferably in Java.
<br>
So what are you waiting for? Bang On! Contribute your codes here and maintain a Github Contribution streak.üòÅ<br>
## Note Section
Note#1 -> Create a seperate folder and include your code file as well as problem statement (use the .github/problem_template.md for problem statement)
<br>
Note#2 -> Try to always include a special type of solution <br>
<br>
*
**Please use format of problem_template from .github directory for submitting your problem statement**
