# [Problem: Digit Sum Parities](https://www.codechef.com/problems/DIGSMPAR)

For a positive integer M, MoEngage defines digitSum(M) as the sum of digits of the number M (when written in decimal). <br>
For example, digitSum(1023)=1+0+2+3=6. <br>
Given a positive integer N, find the smallest integer X strictly greater than N such that - digitSum(N) and digitSum(X) have different parity, i.e. one of them is odd and the other is even.

## Input

- The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. The description of the T test cases follow.
- Each test case consists of a single line of input with a single integer, the number N.

## Constraints

- 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
- 1 ≤ N < 10<sup>9</sup>

## Output

- For each test case, print in a single line, an integer, the answer to the problem.

## Sample

- Input:
```
3
123
19
509
```

- Output:
```
124
21
511
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: digitSum(123)=1+2+3=6 is even and digitSum(124)=1+2+4=7 is odd, so the answer is 124. <br>
- For case 2: digitSum(19)=1+9=10 is even, digitSum(20)=2+0=2 is also even, whereas digitSum(21)=2+1=3 is odd. Hence, the answer is 21. <br>
- For case 3: digitSum(509)=5+0+9=14 is even, digitSum(510)=5+1+0=6 is also even, whereas digitSum(511)=5+1+1=7 is odd. Hence, the answer is 511.
