# [Problem: Covid Spread](https://www.codechef.com/problems/COVSPRD)

A disease is spreading through ChefLand!

The disease spreads as follows:
- At the end of day 0, a single person is infected with the disease.
- During the next 10 days, the number of infected people doubles each day, until the disease has spread to all people in ChefLand.
- From day 11 onwards, the number of infected people triples each day, until the disease has spread to all people in ChefLand.

You are given the population of ChefLand N and a day D. How many people in ChefLand are infected at the end of day D?

## Input

- The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
- Each test case consists of a single line containing two space-separated integers N and D — the population of ChefLand and the day for which you need to find the number of infected people, respectively.

## Constraints

- 1 ≤ T ≤ 300
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 10<sup>8</sup>
- 0 ≤ D ≤ 10<sup>8</sup>

## Output

For each test case, print one line containing a single integer — the number of infected people in ChefLand at the end of day D.

## Sample

- Input:
```
4
100 3
2000 10
6000 11
10 11
```

- Output:
```
8
1024
3072
10
```

## Explanation

- For case 1:
  - At the end of day 1, the number of infected people is 2×1=2.
  - At the end of day 2, the number of infected people is 2×2=4.
  - At the end of day 3, the number of infected people is 2×4=8.
- For case 2: Following the rules in the statement, it can be seen that at the end of day 10, the total number of infected people is 1024.
- For case 3: Note that starting at day 11, the number of infected people triples each day, 3×1024=3072.
- For case 4: At the end of day 3, the number of infected people is 8. Since there are only 10 people in ChefLand (which is less than 2×8=16), at the end of day 4 all people in ChefLand are infected and thus the number of infected people is 10 for all days from day 4 onwards, including day 11.
