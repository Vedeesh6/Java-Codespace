# [Problem: Closest Vowels](https://www.codechef.com/problems/CLOSEVOWEL)

Chef considers a string consisting of lowercase English alphabets beautiful if all the characters of the string are vowels.

Chef has a string S consisting of lowercase English alphabets, of length N. He wants to convert S into a beautiful string T. In order to do so, Chef does the following operation on every character of the string:

- If the character is a consonant, change the character to its closest vowel.
- If the character is a vowel, don't change it.

Chef realizes that the final string T is not unique. Chef wonders, what is the total number of distinct beautiful strings T that can be obtained by performing the given operations on the string S.

Since the answer can be huge, print it modulo 10<sup>9</sup>+7.

Note:
- There are 26 characters in the English alphabet. Five of these characters are vowels: a, e, i, o, and u. The remaining 21 characters are consonants.
- The closest vowel to a consonant is the vowel that is least distant from that consonant. For example, the distance between the characters d and e is 1 while the distance between the characters d and a is 3.
- The distance between the characters z and a is 25 and not 1.

## Input

- The first line of input will contain an integer T — the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains an integer N, denoting the length of the string S.
- The second line of each test case contains a string S consisting of lowercase English alphabets.

## Constraints

- 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 10<sup>5</sup>
- Sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 10<sup>5</sup>.

## Output

For each test case, output the total number of distinct beautiful strings T that can be obtained by performing the given operations on the string S, modulo 10<sup>9</sup>+7.

## Sample

- Input:
```
4
5
aeiou
5
abcde
8

```

- Output:
```
1
2
4
4
```

## Explanation

- For case 1: All the characters of the string S are vowels. Thus, none of the characters would be changed. The resulting string T will be aeiou.
- For case 2: There are 2 possible strings that can be obtained by performing the given operations on the string S. Those are aaaee and aaeee.
