# [Problem: Zero String](https://www.codechef.com/problems/ZEROSTRING)

## Problem
You are given a binary string S of length N. You are allowed to perform the following types of operations on string S: <br>
- Delete any one character from S, and concatenate the remaining parts of the string. For example, if we delete the third character of S=1101, it becomes S=111.
- Flip all the characters of S. For example, if we flip all character of S=1101, it becomes S=0010. <br>
Given that you can use either type of operation any number of times, find the minimum number of operations required to make all characters of the string S equal to 0.

## Input

- The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. <br>
- Each test case consists of multiple lines of input. <br>
  - The first line of each test case contains an integer N — the length of the string. <br>
  - The next line contains a binary string S of length N.

## Constraints

- 1≤T≤2000
- 1≤N≤10 
- S contains 0 and 1 only.
- The sum of N over all test cases won't exceed 2⋅10<sup>5</sup>
 .

## Output

For each test case, output on a new line, the minimum number of operations required to make all characters of the string S equal to 0.

## Sample

- Input:
```
4
2
01
3
101
3
111
4
0000
```

- Output:
```
1
2
1
0
```

## Explanation

- For case 1:  You can use one operation to delete the second character of the string S. Thus, the string becomes 0. Note that all characters of this string are 0 and thus, it satisfies the conditions. <br>
- For case 2: You can perform the following operations: 
  - Operation 1: Flip all characters of the string. Thus, string becomes 010.
  - Operation 2: Delete the second character of the string. Thus, string becomes 00. <br>
  Note that we have obtained a string having all characters as 0 in two operations. It can be shown that this is the minimum number of operations required.
