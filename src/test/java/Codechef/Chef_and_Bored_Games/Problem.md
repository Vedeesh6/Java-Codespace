# [Problem: Chef and Bored Games](https://www.codechef.com/problems/PCJ18B) 

Chef has recently been playing a lot of chess in preparation for the ICCT (International Chef Chess Tournament). <br>
Since putting in long hours is not an easy task, Chef's mind wanders elsewhere. He starts counting the number of squares with odd side length on his chessboard. <br>
However, Chef is not satisfied. He wants to know the number of squares of odd side length on a generic N∗N chessboard.

## Input

- The first line will contain a single integer T, the number of test cases.
- The next T lines will have a single integer N, the size of the chess board.

## Constraints

- 1 ≤ T ≤ 100
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000

## Output

For each test case, print a integer denoting the number of squares with odd length.

## Sample

- Input:
```
2
3
8
```

- Output:
```
10
120
```
